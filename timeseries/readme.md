# Timeseries backend plugin

This plugin enables high-throughput Timeseries with recasta cloud via our API. We have Grafana builtin in this container to enable fast prototyping, but you can use any external services, too. The plugin connects to our streaming REST Api, iterate over /objects and build a timeseries structure for every device found. This plugin can be used as an blueprint, or hosted somewhere. We fully comply to GDPR and CCPA, and our users get full data ownership with our pluggable solution. This plugin supports TLS 1.2 up and our JWT token system.  

## Connector Setup

Simply set the username, password and api url environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:
```
USERNAME=Your recasta User Name  
PASSWORD=Your recasta Password
API_URL=FQDN API Endpoint (like https://api.recasta.cloud)
```
The API Endpoint must be reachable via DNS, and the CA must be known.  
  
Then we can run everything from the repository root via:

```
docker-compose -f timeseries/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

## Grafana Setup

First visit `localhost:3000` and sign in with the default grafana admin credentials (username=admin and password=admin). Follow the instructions to change the password accordingly.

We provisioning redis-timeseries as a default datasource, to get started import the sample dashboard provided in this repository (`sample-dashboard.json`) by clicking on Create -> Import -> Upload JSON File.  

Starting Grafana 7.0 and later with a new plug-in platform supported, there is a new plug-in introduced by Redis Labs so called [Redis Application](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/redis-app). The Redis Application, is a plug-in for Grafana that provides custom panels for Redis Data Source. We already added the app into the docker compose.

## Redis Timeseries / Redis Enterprise Cloud

We are using [Redislab Timeseries](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/), for any documentation how to build dashboards using the redislab timeseries datasource please visit the link.  
The plugin works with [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/), you need to edit the connection string in [provisioning/datasources/redists.yaml](provisioning/datasources/redists.yaml) with your credentials, like:
```
url: redis://instancename.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com:18029
password: 'CHAMGEME'
user: 'CHAMGEME'
database: 'DATABASE'
basicAuth: false
```
and [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)   
```
REDIS_ADDR=redis://username:password@instancename.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com:18029
```
